            teenager
            got two
            incorrect wisdom teeth removed. he speculates away about how this original asymmetry induces subsequent
            asymmetries,
            dense disintegration. insistent entropy sprouting out of the embodied error and lack: trigger for
            displacements and
            miss-identifications.</p>

          loop, as if

        <p>it is hard work to stay, patient and firm and undone, in the non-territory you have to keep making yours,
          every day,
          every encounter. it is hard work to learn to be a lover again. so you write less and less, make lists instead,
          lists of
          lists, you lose track. you hope, each cross-out a breath, at best. but with each breath new sprouts sprout
          out, ivy
          mesh. admit, though, irresponsible young warrior, there is a sense of violent undoing in this voracity to open
          with your
          curious touch, to go and see and yes yes to win a brand new puzzle to solve because this time around you feel
          you do
          have a choice, you can actually pick the part, pick the team. so you keep upping your game until you really
          have to let
          it all melt into thick heavy cocktail that will offer the airy pearly bubble of... something closer to you.
          time is a
          verb.</p>
