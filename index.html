            <p>one morning, ornello balestro realizes that his life-long misery begun at the dentist’s when he as a
              teenager
              got two
              incorrect wisdom teeth removed. he speculates away about how this original asymmetry induces subsequent
              asymmetries,
              dense disintegration. insistent entropy sprouting out of the embodied error and lack: trigger for
              displacements and

            <p>a vast majority of your time sips into motionless staring at photos of your bare chest. you see himself
              for
              the first
              time, equally amazed every time, and for some reason you stay there, unable to snap out of the enthralling
              loop, as if
              this was a doing, an essential part of becoming, as if without the staring something risked being unmade.

        <p>it is hard work to stay, patient and firm and undone, in the non-territory you have to keep making yours,
          every day,
          every encounter. it is hard work to learn to be a lover again. so you write less and less, make lists instead,
          lists of
          lists, you lose track. you hope, each cross-out a breath, at best. but with each breath new sprouts sprout
          out, ivy
          mesh. admit, though, irresponsible young warrior, there is a sense of violent undoing in this voracity to open
          with your
          curious touch, to go and see and yes yes to win a brand new puzzle to solve because this time around you feel
          you do
          have a choice, you can actually pick the part, pick the team. so you keep upping your game until you really
          have to let
          it all melt into thick heavy cocktail that will offer the airy pearly bubble of... something closer to you.
          time is a
          verb.</p>
